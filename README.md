# The TouchRemix sound theme

![Ubuntu Touch](/banner.jpg)

The TouchRemix sound theme is a proposal for new default system sounds for Ubuntu 18.04. Based on [Jouni Helminen](http://www.helminen.co)'s awesome work for Ubuntu Touch, these sounds use a similar instrumentation. The _desktop-login_ sound is a replication of the ringtone "Ubuntu".

The intention was to create a cohesive set of sounds that will enhance the user experience without getting in the way. 

Enjoy!
